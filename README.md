# TheRoute
## TheRoute is a web application that allows roadtrippers to plan and save stops for possible roadtrip adventures. A stress-free and simplified way to plan road trips!
Users can create their login, start planning their route, then save their trip to look at later. Users can add a start and stop, add waypoints, and use a search bar for ease of mind when planning their trip. There is also the option to see the weather at the location, budget how much money they will spend, and track their own expenses.
